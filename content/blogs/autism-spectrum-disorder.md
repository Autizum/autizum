## Introduction

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition that affects millions of people worldwide. With rising autism awareness, it’s crucial to understand the early signs of autism, its causes, and how it is diagnosed. At Autizum, we believe in providing accurate information and support to help individuals and families navigate life with autism.

## What is Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)?

ASD is a broad spectrum disorder, meaning individuals experience a wide range of symptoms and challenges. While some autistic individuals require support in daily activities, others may lead independent lives and even excel in specific fields like technology, arts, and mathematics.

## Trending Autism Symptoms to Look Out For

- Delayed speech development (common autism trait in toddlers)
- Repetitive behaviors (stimming) such as hand-flapping or rocking
- Sensory processing issues (hypersensitivity to sounds, textures, or lights)
- Struggles with eye contact and social cues
- Fixation on specific interests or activities
- Difficulty with changes in routine

## What Causes Autism?

While the exact causes remain unknown, research suggests that genetics, prenatal factors, and environmental triggers play a role.

### Genetic Factors

Studies indicate that autism is highly heritable and runs in families. Specific gene mutations linked to brain development can contribute to ASD.

### Environmental Factors

Exposure to pollutants, heavy metals, and certain medications during pregnancy may increase autism risks. Contrary to myths, vaccines do **NOT** cause autism—a claim that has been debunked by global health organizations.

## How is Autism Diagnosed?

Doctors use a combination of:

- **M-CHAT (Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers)** for early screening
- **DSM-5 criteria** for autism diagnosis
- **Comprehensive behavioral assessments**

At Autizum, we encourage early diagnosis as it leads to better intervention and improved long-term outcomes.

## Conclusion

Raising autism awareness is crucial in promoting inclusion and support for individuals with ASD. Whether you’re a parent, caregiver, or educator, knowing the signs of autism can help in providing early intervention. Stay informed with Autizum—your trusted source for autism education and support.
