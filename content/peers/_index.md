  title: "Why Choose PEERS® and not other social skills methods"
  details: 
    - "The PEERS® program has demonstrated effectiveness through multiple randomized controlled trials, with evidence of maintained gains 1–5 years post-treatment (Laugeson et al., 2015)."
    - "After completing the 16-week PEERS® program, caregivers reported overall improvements in social skills, including cooperative social behavior with peers and family members, increased social assertiveness, and enhanced self-control (Laugeson et al., 2015)."
    - "Participants showed significant gains in social responsiveness, attributed to the program’s focus on receptive and expressive social communication skills (Laugeson et al., 2015)."
    - "Empathy also improved significantly among participants, likely due to the development of social cognitive skills that help them better understand others’ mental and emotional states (Baron-Cohen & Wheelwright, 2004)."
