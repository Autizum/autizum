    <h2 class="text-center mb-4"><i class="fas fa-book-open" style="color: #532c96;"></i>  Why Choose PEERS® and not other social skills method:
    </h2>
    <h3>A Look into the ongoing Research:
    </h3>
    <p>
      The PEERS® program has demonstrated effectiveness through multiple randomized controlled trials, with evidence of maintained gains 1–5 years post-treatment (Laugeson et al., 2015). 
    </p>
    <p> After completing the 16-week PEERS® program, caregivers reported overall improvements in social skills, including cooperative social behavior with peers and family members, increased social assertiveness, and enhanced self-control (Laugeson et al., 2015). 
      <div class="col-">
        <ul class="list-group">
          <li class="list-group-item">
            <i class="fas fa-check-circle" style="color: #532c96;"></i> Participants showed significant gains in social responsiveness, attributed to the program’s focus on receptive and expressive social communication skills (Laugeson et al., 2015). 
          </li>
          <li class="list-group-item">
            <i class="fas fa-check-circle" style="color: #532c96;"></i> Empathy also improved significantly among participants, likely due to the development of social cognitive skills that help them better understand others’ mental and emotional states (Baron-Cohen & Wheelwright, 2004).
          </li>
          <li class="list-group-item">
            <i class="fas fa-check-circle" style="color: #532c96;"></i> The program reduced self-reported loneliness by encouraging greater participation in social activities and hobbies while fostering meaningful friendships (Laugeson et al., 2015).
          </li>
          <li class="list-group-item">
            <i class="fas fa-check-circle" style="color: #532c96;"></i> Caregivers reported a marked increase in the frequency of social invitations received by participants from non-PEERS® friends (Laugeson et al., 2015).

  <div class="container">
    <h2 class="text-center mb-4"><i class="fas fa-flask" style="color: #532c96;"></i> What Does It Mean to Be Evidence-Based?</h2>
    <p>
      To earn the label Evidence-Based, the PEERS® program underwent rigorous clinical trials and comprehensive research to collect data supporting its efficacy. 
      </p><p>
These trials demonstrate the program’s ability to deliver measurable, replicable benefits in social skills and overall psychosocial functioning (Laugeson et al., 2015).
